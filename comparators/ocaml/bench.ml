(* OCaml DEFLATE comparator for the lean-zip Track D dashboard.

   Uses the pure-OCaml `decompress` library (mirage/decompress), specifically
   its RFC1951 raw-DEFLATE codec `De` (sublibrary decompress.de). We drive the
   library's `De.Higher` streaming helpers over the whole payload in one go;
   `Higher.compress`/`uncompress` are documented as the equivalent of
   `Zlib.{compress,uncompress} ~header:false`, i.e. raw DEFLATE with no
   zlib/gzip wrapper.

   Honours the shared comparator contract:

     bench <payload.bin> <level>  ->  stdout JSON
     {"out_size":N,"compress_mbps":X,"decompress_mbps":Y,
      "timing_aggregation":"median","timing_reps":5}

   Timing mirrors ZipBenchReport.lean / the Go and JS comparators: median-of-5
   reps, itersFor(size) iters per rep, throughput measured against the
   *uncompressed* byte count. Self-verifies its roundtrip before timing. *)
