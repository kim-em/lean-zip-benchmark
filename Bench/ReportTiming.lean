/-! Shared timing policies for the benchmark reports.

Routine dashboard data has one protocol: median-of-5. Keep the repetition
count here so the measurement loop, JSON provenance, and tests cannot drift
independently. The frozen zopfli ceiling is the sole one-repetition exception;
its speed is explicitly an artifact rather than benchmark evidence. -/
