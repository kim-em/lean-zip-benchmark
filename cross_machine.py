"""Cross-machine consistency report for the Track D dashboard.

Compares two `bench-report` result JSONs (an OLD machine and a NEW machine) and
emits a Markdown report on how the two machines relate, per compressor and per
metric. Used when migrating the canonical benchmark machine (e.g. chungus →
chungus2) to decide whether the move is sound.

Usage:
    python3 cross_machine.py OLD.json NEW.json > report.md

What it checks
--------------
* **Compression ratio** is deterministic and machine-independent, so for the
  *same code* it must be byte-identical across machines. A per-compressor
  `max |Δratio|` therefore separates two effects:
    - external comparators (go/js/zig/ocaml/zlib/miniz_oxide/libdeflate) run the
      *same* third-party code on both machines → any ratio delta is version drift
      in the pinned toolchain, and should be ~0;
    - `native` (lean-zip) may legitimately differ if the two snapshots are at
      different commits — that is a *code* delta, not a machine delta, and is
      called out separately so it is not mistaken for machine inconsistency.
* **Throughput** (`compress_mbps`, `decompress_mbps`): the geomean of
  NEW/OLD per compressor is the machine speed factor. If it is roughly uniform
  across compressors, the two machines are consistently related (one is ~X%
  faster); large per-compressor spread is the signal that the machines are NOT
  cleanly comparable and the move needs scrutiny.

Only `(compressor, pattern, level)` cells present in BOTH inputs are compared.
