# check-cargo-lock.sh -- trip wire for miniz_oxide / adler2 version drift.
#
# Advisory only: always exits 0. Prints a warning at PR-review time if
# the resolved `miniz_oxide` / `adler2` versions in
# bench/rust/miniz_oxide_shim/Cargo.lock have drifted from the snapshot
# audited in SECURITY_INVENTORY.md § "miniz_oxide via Rust" (the
# *"`Cargo.lock` is tracked and treated as security-critical"* bullet
# under *Current local guardrails*).
#
# Drift does not mean "broken"; it means "re-read the *Why trusted*
# paragraph for `miniz_oxide via Rust`, decide whether the new resolved
# versions are acceptable, and update the *Snapshot as of …* line in
# SECURITY_INVENTORY.md to match (or roll back the lockfile change)."
#
# Run before opening a PR that touches `bench/rust/miniz_oxide_shim/`.
#
# This is a trip wire, not a fence. It is not wired into CI — the goal
# is to make accidental Cargo.lock churn visible in a `git diff`, not
# to reject it automatically. Sibling helper to
# scripts/check-c-allocations.sh, which performs the same role for
# c/zlib_ffi.c allocation sites.
#
# Requirements: pure POSIX shell + standard text tools (grep, awk,
# sed). No Cargo or Rust toolchain required.
#
# Manual smoke tests:
#   1. Drift detection: temporarily edit the *Snapshot as of …* line in
#      SECURITY_INVENTORY.md to mention an obviously wrong version
#      (e.g. `miniz_oxide` 9.9.9), re-run this script, expect a single
#      DRIFT WARNING block followed by exit 0, then revert the edit.
#   2. Parser-mismatch diagnostic: temporarily replace the single space
#      between the closing backtick and the version triple with two
#      spaces (e.g. ``` `miniz_oxide`  0.8.9 ```), re-run this script,
#      expect a *parser regex mismatch* WARNING block followed by
#      exit 0 (not a blank-`expected:` DRIFT block), then revert.
