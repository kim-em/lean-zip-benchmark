/-! Deterministic **cross-engine interop** fuzz for the encoder: does our
raw-DEFLATE output actually interoperate with the rest of the ecosystem,
across the whole level ladder × a diverse input-shape generator?

### What this is *not* for

Native encode → native decode being the identity is already a **theorem**:
`Deflate.inflate_deflateRaw` (`Zip/Spec/DeflateRoundtripProduction.lean`) proves
`inflate (deflateRaw data level) = .ok data`, sorry-free, for *every*
input and *every* level (its proof branches through level-0 stored, the
L1/respread band, the #2638 L9-fast parse, and the level-10 crown). Totality
likewise makes "native encode/decode never panics" a proof obligation, not a
test one. So this driver does **not** exist to re-check the self-roundtrip —
over the Lean model that is redundant.

### What this *is* for

The roundtrip proof shows we agree with *ourselves*; it says nothing about
whether the rest of the ecosystem agrees with us. zlib, libdeflate, and
miniz_oxide are opaque external C/Rust — Lean has no model of them, so
their acceptance of our output is not a theorem and cannot be one. This
driver checks that empirically. For a seeded, deterministic spread of
input shapes and **every level 0-9**:

1. **Interop out** (load-bearing) — `{zlib, libdeflate, miniz_oxide}
   .decompress (deflateRaw input level) == input`: our output is raw
   DEFLATE that *stricter* reference decoders accept, not just our own
   lenient one. This is the real payload. The bug class it catches: an
   encoder that emits a stream our own proven-correct decoder happily
   round-trips (so `inflate_deflateRaw` still holds) but that a conforming
   decoder rejects — e.g. the `repairBl` regression's incomplete Huffman
   code sets, which native inflate tolerated and zlib rejected. A roundtrip
   proof is blind to that by construction.
2. **Interop in** (load-bearing) — `Inflate.inflate ({zlib, libdeflate}
   .compress input level) == input`: our decoder accepts a *different*
   encoder's conforming output. This exercises decoder **completeness**
   against a real-world stream distribution — a direction the roundtrip
   theorem does not cover (it only proves we decode *our own* output).
3. **Self-roundtrip / no-panic** (free cross-check) — we do also assert
   `inflate (deflateRaw input level) == input` and that nothing panics.
   These are covered by the theorems above; we keep them only because they
   ride for free alongside the interop decode calls and cheaply cross-check
   the compiled binary against the proven model (a Lean codegen / FFI-glue
   miscompilation gap). They are not the coverage this file adds.

So the one-line justification is: the guard against a ladder-redesign or
fast-emit regression producing output that round-trips through *our*
decoder but that zlib/libdeflate/miniz reject (or vice versa) — the one
failure mode the encoder proofs cannot see.

The driver is deterministic: the shape × size × level matrix is a fixed
enumeration and the PRNG-filled payloads derive from a fixed seed, so a
failure reproduces exactly. Reference engines absent at build time
(libdeflate, miniz_oxide) skip cleanly, as elsewhere.

Distinct from — cite, don't duplicate:
* **#2575** owns the window / 64 KiB-stored-block *boundary* roundtrip
  specifics; this is the broader level×shape×engine matrix.
* **#2591** owns the RLE/overlap period sweep on the decode side.
* **#2582-2585** are decode-direction malformed-reject fuzz (opposite
  property).

/-! ## Broken-encoder sanity check

A meta-test on the harness itself: if the encoder emitted a corrupt
stream, `checkCell`'s decode assertions must fire. We simulate a broken
encoder by flipping one output byte *after* compression and confirm that
the corruption is caught by **both** load-bearing decoders — native
inflate (the self-roundtrip assertion) *and* the mandatory zlib comparator
(the interop-out assertion). Requiring both guards against either assertion
being silently removed, and against a native-encode/native-decode pair that
shares a blind spot the reference engine would not. A byte flip is "caught"
by a decoder when it rejects the stream or decodes it to bytes ≠ the
original; we scan every byte position and require at least one flip caught
by each decoder, failing only if the whole stream tolerates corruption —
which would mean the property is not load-bearing. -/
