# Run a command pinned to the idlest CPU core: pin_core.sh <cmd> [args...]
#
# Every throughput number recorded under results/ is a snapshot of one
# machine, and the dashboard compares snapshots across runs and branches — so
# a measurement that wanders across cores (scheduler migrations, turbo and
# cache effects, contention with concurrent builds on a shared box) adds
# run-to-run noise that has repeatedly been mistaken for real perf deltas.
# Pinning to a single idle core is the cheap fix, but only when every caller
# remembers to do it; this wrapper makes it automatic for the bench pipeline
# (run.sh and the perf-pr-graphs skill route measurements through it).
#
# Core choice: sample /proc/stat twice, 300 ms apart, and score each candidate
# by its idle fraction over the interval, downgraded to the *minimum* idle
# fraction across its SMT sibling group (an "idle" hyperthread whose twin runs
# a build still shares the physical core's execution resources — exactly the
# contention this wrapper exists to avoid). Candidates are intersected with
# the process's allowed affinity set (cgroup cpuset, CI slice, or an outer
# taskset), so the pick can never be a core we may not use. Ties go to the
# highest-numbered core, least likely to pick up stray OS work. The pinned
# command and all its children inherit the affinity.
#
# On systems without taskset or /proc/stat (e.g. macOS), or if anything about
# the selection fails, exec the command unpinned rather than blocking the
# benchmark — the recorded numbers carry the machine in the dashboard meta.
