# Regenerate the Track D benchmark dashboard end to end:
#   1. build + run the matrix    → results/latest.json  (lake exe bench-report)
#   2. dump the exact payloads    → payloads/<corpus>/*.bin
#   3. build + run the external comparators
#      (zlib-rs / zlib-ng / Go / JS / Zig / OCaml),
#      merging their rows into the same JSON
#   4. render the static SVGs and untracked animation previews
#
# The tracked history animations are intentionally a second step: their final
# frame embeds the benchmark-data commit's SHA, date, and subject, so the data
# must be committed before they can be regenerated reproducibly:
#   run.sh --history-only
# Preserve that data commit afterward: merge dashboard PRs with a merge commit,
# never squash or rebase them.
#
# Run from anywhere in the repo. The Lean matrix and plotting use the project
# nix-shell (zlib + cargo for the FFI comparators, python3 + matplotlib for the
# plots); the external comparators each pull their own toolchain (see
# comparators/build_all.sh) and are run with node + python3 on PATH.
#
# Note: throughput numbers are a median-of-5 snapshot of THIS machine for every
# corpus; commit the regenerated JSON + static SVGs together. Machine-readable
# timing metadata is validated before routine snapshots can be merged or plotted.
# The whole-tar experiment is separate: its timing uses meta.reps (normally 9),
# and its peak-RSS fields come from one fresh process per implementation.
#
# Every *measurement* step below runs through pin_core.sh, which pins the
# command (and its children) to the idlest single core — unpinned runs wander
# across cores and pick up scheduler/turbo/contention noise that has been
# mistaken for real perf deltas. Builds, merges, and plotting stay unpinned.

# Whole-tar L6 measurement: record BOTH honest sections on the COLD whole
# silesia.tar into results/whole_tar_l6.json —
#   codec:      native vs miniz_oxide through the same lean `bench` harness
#               (readBinFile I/O cancels), a codec-CPU regression guard;
#   end_to_end: the real lean `compress-file` CLI vs the real rust
#               `miniz-compress-file` CLI as fresh processes, the honest
#               `zip silesia.tar` wall (currently rust marginally ahead on the
#               lean CLI's file-read/alloc path), plus each CLI's peak RSS
#               (maxrss_kb + rss_ratio, via GNU time -v) — the whole-tar
#               memory footprint.
# The per-file dashboard ($OUT) tracks WARM per-file throughput and misses the
# `zip silesia.tar` cold-stream workload, where a deeper L6 probe / rolling can
# regress invisibly (three PRs did). This is a MEASUREMENT that records — not a
# gate — surfaced in the perf-graphs review. Pinned like the other measurement
# steps; miniz here is deterministic and cheap, so it runs on both paths. Needs
# the `bench` + `compress-file` lean exes and the rust `miniz-compress-file` bin
# (built via the shim's cargo, which emits both the staticlib and the bin).
# Guarded on the silesia corpus.
